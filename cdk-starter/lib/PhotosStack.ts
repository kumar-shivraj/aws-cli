    // we can delete it with following commands through aws cli as well :
    // aws s3 rb s3://photos-bucket-shivraj
    // aws s3 rb s3://photos-bucket-shivraj --force
    // The --force flag ensures that the bucket is deleted even if it contains objects or versions. However, itâ€™s important to confirm that the bucket is empty before proceeding.
    // We can also verify with below commands once the bucket is deleted :
    // aws s3 ls
    // then we will try to deploy our code with the updated construct id : "PhotoBucket-changed"
    // if still failing the error for the stack then we can try deleting the stack and then deploy again
    // aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name PhotosStack

    // manually give the logical id for the resource ourself
